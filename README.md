# ⌚ FitCloudPro Watchface Uploader Helper

This is a simple Windows `.bat` script that helps automate the process of replacing the temporary watchface file generated by **FitCloudPro** when uploading custom `.bin` watchfaces.

Instead of manually renaming files and navigating folders, this tool takes care of renaming and replacing the temporary file for you.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

FitCloudPro-compatible watches allow uploading custom watchfaces, but the app generates a temporary file with a random name (e.g., `temp_xxxxxxx.bin`) that must be manually replaced with your own `.bin` file.

This script streamlines that process by:
- Automatically detecting the temporary `temp_*.bin` file.
- Replacing its contents with your custom `.bin` watchface.
- Keeping the original filename so that FitCloudPro will still recognize it.

## 🛠 How to Use

1. **Open the FitCloudPro app** on your phone.
2. Go to the **Dial Market** and select the **first customizable watchface**.
3. Tap **Create**, but **do not tap Push**.
4. **Without closing the app**, switch to your phone’s file manager.
5. Navigate to:
Android/data/com.topstep.fitcloudpro/files/download/
6. Copy the file that starts with `temp_` (e.g., `temp_98374.bin`) **to your PC**.
7. Place the following files in the same folder as this script:
- The copied `temp_*.bin` file
- Your custom `.bin` watchface file (with any name)

8. **Run the script** (`replace_watchface.bat`):
- It will detect both `.bin` files
- Replace the contents of `temp_*.bin` with your custom file
- Preserve the original filename

9. Go back to the **FitCloudPro app** and now tap **Push**.

✅ Your custom watchface should now upload and install!

## ⚠️ Notes

- The folder **must contain exactly 2 `.bin` files**:
  - One starting with `temp_`
  - One being your custom `.bin` watchface
- If not, the script will show a clear error message.
- UTF-8 encoding is handled automatically for proper character display.
